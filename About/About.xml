	<description>Hey guys!
I've loved this mod since I found it, and was pretty bummed to hear that CrunchyDuck was no longer part of the RimWorld modding scene.
So, I decided to pick up where they left off and continue support for [b]Math![/b]

I've so far only added skill comparisons (after filtering for pawns, either compare two skills or one against a constant value) but I'll add more variables and comparisons as I think of them / need them in gameplay.
Feel free to request variables/comparisons, I'm more than happy to add them if possible.

Everything I've added has documentation in the [b]Math![/b] in-game info pane, just as the original mod does.

CrunchyDuck's Original Description:
--------------------------------------
[h2]What does this mod do?[/h2]
[list]
[*]Ability to perform [b]Math![/b] with a huge range of variables, from "how many pawns have the fast walker trait", to "how much food do our colonists need to eat per day"
[*]Create your own variables to cut down on the amount of [b]Math![/b] you need to do
[*]New field to calculate how much of an item exists - Want you simple meal production to count all meals, not just simple? Use "categories.meals"!
[*]Larger bill details
[*]Robust in-game info button with examples, variables and explanations for using [b]Math![/b]
[/list]
Many features from the mod [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=935982361]Better Workbench Management[/url] have been added, such as:
[list]
[*]Dragging bills to rearrange
[*]Linking [b]any[/b] bills together to match their settings, as well as options to choose what settings are matched.
[*]A button to easily switch between "take to stockpile" and "drop on floor"
[*]Renaming bills!
[/list]

[h2]Compatibility[/h2]
[list]
[*]Any mods that add new things (food, weapons, really anything) will be compatible and usable as variables.
[*]Compatible with new saves. Removing from a save will produce a one-time error.
[*]Compatible with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2033979700]Project Rimfactory[/url] (Thanks to [url=https://github.com/ruifung]ruifung[/url])
[*]Supports using loadout tags from [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2679126859]Compositable Loadouts[/url] ([url=https://github.com/ruifung]ruifung[/url] again)

[*]Incompatible with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=935982361]Better Workbench Management[/url]. Most of its functionality has been integrated into this mod anyway.
[/list]

[h2]Languages[/h2]
[b]Math![/b] will allow you to use variables in your native language.
However, right now none of my tutorials/explanations are in other languages. I have everything set up to support other languages, but none made yet.
If you speak any language besides English or Spanish and wish to contribute, I'd be happy to discuss it in my Discord.
