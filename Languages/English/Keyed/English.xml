	<!-- Update logs -->
	<CD.M.updates.1.3>User variables:
You can now create and save equations as variables! You type out an equation, give it a name, and then you can reuse that anywhere you want! More info can be found in the infocard at "Basic.Making a custom variable".
User variables are remembered between saves, so once you type it out, you have it for as long as you want it. This can cut down on long equations quite a bit, allow for more complicated usage without becoming unwieldy, and reduce the amount of copying and pasting done.

Future plans:
Speaking of copying and pasting, that's next on the agenda: I'm working on an improvement to Better Workbench Management's Linking system. I'm really excited to get this done, expect it in the near future.
I also want to make my mod compatible with Compositable Loadouts. It's been requested a few times, and it looks like a good mod.

Minor changes:
Added this window! I wanted to find a way to inform people on what's updated, but I don't like shoving something in someone's face the moment they start up the game.
Added "mechanoids" pawn group, and stopped mechanoids being counted in "pawns"
Added a close button to the infocard, at weirdly high request.
Ingredient radius now properly renders.</CD.M.updates.1.3>
	<CD.M.updates.1.4>This week I've been hard at work on linking bills!
You'll now see a "link" button appear on bills when you have a copied bill. Clicking this will link from the copied bill (The parent), to the targeted bill (child).
Linking means that bills will match their settings as best as they can, making it much easier to upkeep a large number of bills that all share similar attributes.

This functionality was inspired by Better Workbench Management, but I've done a lot of work to improve upon it:

First, you can link *any* two bills. BWM only supports linking identical bills.

Second, you can choose want gets linked between bills. Opening a "child" bill, there's a new panel in the bottom left. You can see the bill's parent, and choose what things the parent and child share.

Third, since I use a "parent/child" relationship unlike BWM's "communism" system, you can chain parents. Bill1 -> Bill2 -> Bill3. Anyone experienced with Object Oriented Programming should appreciate that :)

I haven't been able to playtest the bill linking as I've been too busy just *working* on Math!, so it might have some bugs presently. Please report any and I'll be quick to respond.
I'm also aware, it might not look *the best*, visuals aren't my forte. If you have any suggestions on how it can be improved, let me know.

Minor changes:
Added "adults" pawn group.
Been quite focused on linking, so no other small things this time.

Future plans:
There's been a long standing bug where bills will reset to their default values and can't be updated. This has eluded me for some time, as no one could tell me *why* it was happening. But recently I got a lead on what might be causing it, and it's a top priority fix.
Besides that, there's a couple small Better Workbench Management features left to implement.
Copy/pasting is also a touch buggy, so I'll be working on that too.</CD.M.updates.1.4>

	<CD.M.infocard.basic.tutorials.variable_names>Variable names</CD.M.infocard.basic.tutorials.variable_names>
	<CD.M.infocard.basic.tutorials.variable_names.description>You can use variables in your equations, like how many colonists you have, how many of an item you have, or how many of a category of items you have.

To do any of this, you need to convert the name of what you want to search, like "Uranium mace (legendary)", into a variable. It's simple to do!
First, make it lowercase, and wrap it in speech marks.
Item quality, material and stack count should also be omitted from the name.
If it has speech marks or full stops in its name, replace them with an underscore: _
Singular words like ostrich don't always need speechmarks - it's up to you.

Let's look at some examples:
Medicine x5 -> "medicine"
Go-juice -> "go-juice"
Uranium mace (legendary) -> mace</CD.M.infocard.basic.tutorials.variable_names.description>
	<CD.M.infocard.basic.tutorials.itemcount>Using "Custom item count"</CD.M.infocard.basic.tutorials.itemcount>
	<CD.M.infocard.basic.tutorials.itemcount.description>You'll notice that there's a new checkbox on "Do until you have X" bills called "Custom item count".
Turning this on, you can customize what the recipe counts to check how much of something it has.
For example, if you type in "category meals", it will count "simple meal", "fine meal", "packaged survival meal", etc.

Leaving "Custom item count" off will use the default counting logic.</CD.M.infocard.basic.tutorials.itemcount.description>
	<CD.M.infocard.basic.tutorials.user_variables>Making a custom variable</CD.M.infocard.basic.tutorials.user_variables>
	<CD.M.infocard.basic.tutorials.user_variables.description>In bill menus there's a new button in the top left that looks like "{x}". Clicking on this will open up a new window that allows you to name and assign equations!
User variables are remembered between save files, so you can reuse them wherever you like!

Once you've created a variable, you can use it in any input field by typing "variables.name" or "v.name", where "name" is what you called your variable.
For example, you might have the following variable:
meals = "c.meals" - "packaged survival meal"
You could then use this variable in an input field by typing:
"v.meals"

Variables work by directly pasting what you typed into the place of your variable, and surrounding it with brackets. For example:
"v.meals" * 2 -> ("c.meals" - "packaged survival meal") * 2

A variable should be named the same way parameters are - lowercase, no . or " in the name.</CD.M.infocard.basic.tutorials.user_variables.description>

	<CD.M.infocard.basic.tutorials.doXTimes>Equations in "Do X Times" bills</CD.M.infocard.basic.tutorials.doXTimes>
	<CD.M.infocard.basic.tutorials.doXTimes.description>Any equations you put into "Do X Times" will be resolved down into a number, rather than remembered like in "Do Until X".
	
This is done so you can make one-time calculations in the field, like colonists * 3, without the bill running forever.</CD.M.infocard.basic.tutorials.doXTimes.description>

	<CD.M.tutorial.searching.things>Searching Things</CD.M.tutorial.searching.things>
	<CD.M.tutorial.searching.things.description>You can search any Thing in the game such as "slate blocks", ostriches, "compacted steel", etc.
The count you get back will not include forbidden items, and will take into account the recipe's settings. E.G. if an item has 40% hitpoints but recipe requires 50%, it won't be counted.

To search a ThingDef you need to convert the in-game name, make it lowercase, and wrap it in speech marks.
Item quality, material and stack count should also be omitted from the name.
If it has speech marks or full stops in its name, replace them with an underscore: _
Singular words like ostrich don't always need speechmarks - it's up to you.

	<CD.M.tutorial.searching.stats>Searching Thing Stats</CD.M.tutorial.searching.stats>
	<CD.M.tutorial.searching.stats.description>Things have stats like "market value", "nutrition", "mech bandwidth". This mod supports two types of stat searching.

The first type lets you search the stat of a Thing's prefab. This value is always the same, it doesn't depend on how many of that item you have or the quality of those items - It's the value those items normally have.

The second type lets you search the stats of individual items you own. This search is performed by putting "owned", "own" or "o" before the name of the StatDef.

Some examples of both:
"kibble.nutrition" will give you 0.05, the nutritional value of one piece of kibble.
"kibble.owned nutrition" will give you the total nutrition you have in stored kibble.

This also works on categories, and will add up the result from every item in that category.
"category meals.o nutrition" will return how much nutrition you have in stored meals.
"category meals.nutrition" is pretty useless, but shows it's possible.</CD.M.tutorial.searching.stats.description>

	<CD.M.tutorial.searching.categories>Searching categories</CD.M.tutorial.searching.categories>
	<CD.M.tutorial.searching.categories.description>You can search any category of things in game, such as "category raw food", "cat textiles", "c meals", etc. Categories can be seen in any stockpile or bill menu.

Categories are written just like Things, except you start the variable with the word "category"", or "cat", or simply "c".
Here are some examples:
Humanlike corpses -> "category humanlike corpses"
Meals -> "c meals"
Eggs (unfert.) -> "cat eggs (unfert_)"</CD.M.tutorial.searching.categories.description>
